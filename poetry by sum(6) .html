    <h2 style="color: white;"><u>Sea Star</u></h2>
    <p>Wounded soul seeking comfort in the discomfort entity of havoc.<br>
        The known happiness is in waves, the high tides coming at force, it is loud and ambitious.</p>
        <img style="display: block;-webkit-user-select: align-self: right:; ;auto;cursor: zoom-in;background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);transition: background-color 300ms;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/61/33/27/6133275d7bf8dd84c03495abe5be0aef.jpg" width="1430" height="530">
        <p>Everyone talks about it, after all it must be known that it exists from the soul's acknowledgement but as the high becomes the low, <i>silence does it hear</i>.<br>
            The discomfort is too much to bear, too much to handle.<br>

        <p>Everyone does talk yet only when the destruction aftermath occurs, till then must it be silent?<br>
            The comfort of waves is temperament to one wounded soul, must it seek the <b>consciousness</b> of the sea to acquire its knowledge of belief of its <u>chaotic continuing.</u><br> 
            The sea continues on, <strong><em>loud, violent</em></strong>, <i><em></em>tranquilent, quiet</em></i> and all embodiment of consciousness.<br>
    
            The stars shine upon as the waves crash.</p>
