    Killer Star
    </marquee>
    <p><b><i>Misunderstood Angel</i></b>, seeking for the lucky star,<br>
        She scares herself, healing the <em>decaying soul</em> of hers from what she knows,<br>
        Society grieving for who she is, the <i><u>star</u></i> is the key to the unnecessary violence she embodies as survival,<br>
        How to heal that decaying soul of hers? Who is them to tell whatâ€™s right and wrong, <b><i>if she cannot answer for herself.</i></b><br>
        <hr color="red"  width="100%"><i>The loss of blood continues till the flesh and bones are as one, the corpse grows</i></hr><br>
        <hr color="red"  width="100%"> <b><i>Misunderstood Angel</i></b>, you must know this filthy world fulfilling the law of ordered chaos is a representation of you,</hr><br>
        The lucky star is <em><u>arriving</u></em>, hold onto the hope that you must carry till the end of <b>time</b>,<br>
        After all death is <b>inevitable</b>, you must learn what that constitutes.<br>
        <strong>Time</strong> is near, soon the luck you possess allows the star to <u><i>shine.</i></u><br>
