    HER
    </marquee>

<div id="grad">
    <h4 style="color:white;"> Her screams are soundless, reaching a few lengths in <ul><em><i>Hindsight.</i></em></ul><br>
        Yet the Sirens are on the way, she yearns for death but fears the result of <b>destruction</b>,<br>
        <ul><i>Oh how she is Misunderstood.</i></ul><br>
        Let her dream her <em><ul>Violent Pathetic Dreams.</ul></em><br>
        Let it give meaning to her soulless existence in this <u>realm</u> like no other. <i>It is the only thing herself will possess,</i><br>
        <b>The validity of fulfilled destiny is near</b>, intimacy so clear yet so malevolent,<br>
        Love or lust, will it bring her to her knees, pleading for mercy, <ul><i>Will it heal the hearden cracks?</i></ul><br>
        Think twice to arrive at dawn, <i>the star may shine,</i> screaming for redemption to bring <b>chaos</b> in order.<ul><i> Foolish her, but the Clock is Ticking.</i></ul><br>
        <u><strong>Call it love, call it a Whore, her choices are silent by the nature of Law.</strong></u><br>
        Her must leave blindly towards the open black hole of ibis, to her destiny that calls her name.<ul><i>Like a <u>siren</u> tying her in, a smirk on her face, havoc inside her head and blood stain hands,</i></ul><b>Flaws leaving her mark.</b><br></h4>
        <p style="color: white;">Think once, her destiny in your name, sirens in the distance in silence, the night is finally asleep.</p>
